# Intelligence-artificielle-imagerie-mdicale-enrichie-et-non-invasive
This repository is based on my graduation project at XLIM and I3M laboratories on the subject of developing different prototypes of generative networks for reducing the examing time of MRI as well as synthesis images of the test without injecting gadolinium to the patient. This will reinforce security and safety for both patients and the health stuff.

The project is managed using PERT and GANTT diagramms.

The algorithms used in this project are: U-Net and GANs

The Dataset is BRATS2018 which includes IMR images.

The pre-processing	steps of data are image Cropping, one-hot encoding, normalization (filtration, linear intensity correction, bias correction), data augmentation, data split.

If you use the program, please cite us.
